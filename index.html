        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Eiffel Remrem Protocol Interface project contains java interfaces that are implemented by Eiffel protocol</p>
        <p>Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide. Interfaces form a contract
            between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the java compiler.</p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>This project does not need any installation since it is an interface, which is implemented by other projects.</p>
        <p>This project is build by gradle, by executing following commands:</p>
        <p>./gradlew build</p>
        <p>The produced jar file will be stored in /eiffel-remrem-protocol-interface/build/libs/</p>
        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>This project does not need any configuration since it is an interface, which is implemented by other projects.</p>
        <h2>Compatibility</h2>
        <p>All message services need to implement interface provided by this project to communicate properly.</p>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to specify a behavior that classes must implement.
            All methods of an Interface do not contain implementation (method bodies). Interfaces cannot be instantiated, but rather are implemented.
            A class that implements an interface must implement all of the non-default methods described in the interface, or be an abstract
            class. </p>
        <p>The body of the interface contains abstract methods, but since all methods in an interface are, by definition,
            abstract, the abstract keyword is not required. Since the interface specifies a set of exposed behaviors, all methods are implicitly
            public.
            If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods defined by that interface must appear in its source code before the class will
            successfully compile.</p>
        <p>Interfaces are defined by the following syntax.<br>
            public interface MsgService {<br>
            /**<br>
            * Generate takes a partial message in JSON format,<br>
            * validates it and adds mandatory fields before outputting a complete, valid Eiffel message.<br>
            *<br>
            * @param String msgType<br>
            * @param JsonObject jsonMessage<br>
            * @return the generated and validate Eiffel messages as json String<br>
            */<br>
            String generateMsg(String msgType, JsonObject jsonMessage);<br>
            }</p>
        <p>In this example inteface MsgService has only one method generateMsg that consumes String and JsonObject and returns String.
            If a class implements an interface and does not implement all its methods, it must be marked as abstract.
            If a class is abstract, one of its subclasses is expected to implement its unimplemented methods. Although if any of the abstract class'
            subclasses does not implement all interface methods, the subclass itself must be marked again as abstract.</p>
        <p>Classes may implement interfaces. For example,<br>
            public class SemanticsService implements MsgService {<br>
            @Override<br>
            public String generateMsg(String msgType, JsonObject bodyJson) {<br>
            return String result = gson.toJson(jsonMessage);<br>
            }<br>
            }<br></p>
        <p>To create new version of protocol one will need to modify the interface, change the java api docs for methods to represent new version of
            interface and build the jar using gladle. Include builded jar as external library in other projects and in these project implement
            the desired interface.</p>
        <p>Currently interface implementation is in
